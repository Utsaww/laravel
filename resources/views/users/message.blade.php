                    <h3>Welcome to PADHLOJI</h3>
                    <p>Competition is everywhere and it is getting tough with each passing day. Many times, the
						dreams of students who wish to succeed in their goals may remain a dream because of the lack
						of proper guidance and focused training. If a student guided in the right way for the competitive
						exams then success can be achieved. PADHLOJI provides services through classroom-based coaching
						and digital learning, which supplement our classroom courses and allow students to engage in
						self-paced learning. PADHLOJI also offers short-term classroom courses to prepare students for
						upcoming examinations. PADHLOJI have 110+ classroom centres (the "PADHLOJI CLASSES"). With an aim to
						nurture the aspirants of Junior class students, PADHLOJI offer test preparatory courses to students in
						Class 9th &amp; 10th. In addition, PADHLOJI provides training to these students for central and state board
						examinations, and for Junior Competitive Scholarship tests and merit tests, such as Olympiads
						and National Talent Search Examination (NTSE).</p>

            <h2>Dear Friends / Parents and Students,</h2>
            <p>We all have to start somewhere, and doing something is better than nothing at all. Start small so you don't get discouraged and give up. Remember it is all about consistency. Every moment in life is a fresh beginning. That brings with it the boundless joy of new possibilities. And the pleasure is compounded when you know, you are about to realize a lofty goal. If you want to fulfil your dreams, then first you should know about the ground reality of your dreams, how can you make the way to achieve it . When we talks about any competition, then it’s preparation starts with your discipline and mindset so as a teacher I realize that competition is not just preparation, it is a PENANCE (Tapasya) . I hope that you are ready to do penance and our platform will fulfil all your hopes and you will also contribute to the society and the country in future. I wish you a bright future.</p>

            <p>Dear Student and Parents,
            If you are reading this it means you are finding something to help yourself. Education is integral for the growth & development of an individual. The expectation from an educational institute is always about making the society better for all and to bring out one's True Potential in the service of the mankind. So its our moral responsibility to create Best educational platform that serves the society for year after years and making education almost free. As a parent, you definitely want the best for your child and we are happy to be working with you to make sure that they are given the true knowledge to face the challenges in their career. The talent and the energy which our students possess need to be nurtured, shaped and channelled in the right direction. "Your dreams are our inspiration and your destination is our goal". I wish all our students a very successful academic year ahead. I am sure the various services that we offers will be a great boon to our students. Wishing you the very best.</p>

              The institute in which you get knowledge as well as manners, that institute is “aspirations”. This institution is like a family in which we get nurtured. We are given full freedom to ask any question without any hesitation or fear. This institution provides us with extra knowledge too. We just have to focus & learn the concepts / formulas that are being teached by the teacher. I think it is not only a tuition.

             I joined aspirations in 9th standard. Aspirations is a place which makes our dreams come true. It helps us to form base. To me aspirations is not an institute, it is my home. We are not taught maths or science but we are taught to make our aim clear in our mind. The best part about aspirations is that we are not only taught maths & science but many amazing tricks which can help us to perform better.
